# Sewer Rat


## Technologies Used
For this project I used HTML-canvas, Javascript, and bit of CSS. For the canvas I generated a map through iterating over an array of arrays. For each element in the array a tile type is assigned and drawn. For the water spraying and rat additional classes are drawn. The water is drawn based off of a boolean returning from a Math.random() method. Audio plays when the rat moves or the rat encounters a water splash.

## Approach
Initially I intended to make a platformer. My first couple attempts at platform collision (especially when jumping) proved to be difficult to achieve given the time on hand so I switched gears to a top-down maze crawler. 
Once again, collision proved to be difficult to achieve but once a solution was found, all other elements of the game and logic came together quickly.

## Installation
The game requires a browser capable of displaying HTML canvas, reading vanilla JS, CSS animations, and playing audio.
